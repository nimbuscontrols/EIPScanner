# Tests

These tests use the source code of this repo.

Therefore the paths are `"EIPScanner/..."` rather than `<EIPScanner/...>`
* The source files are being linked directly rather than through the EIPScanner `/usr/local/lib` shared object file 


## Requirements

The GMock Library: `sudo apt install libgmock-dev`
